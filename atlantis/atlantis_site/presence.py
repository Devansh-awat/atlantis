"""Who is on the site, and when they were last here.

Nothing else in here records that a user simply *showed up*. Every other
timestamp we keep is attached to something they produced — a project, a lapse,
an order — so a builder who spent an afternoon reading the guides and watching
the queue left no trace at all, and the metrics page could not tell a quiet day
from an empty one.

So this middleware writes two things, and only for signed-in users:
Profile.last_seen, which answers "who is here now", and one ActiveDay row per
user per day, which is the history "how many people were here last Tuesday" is
counted out of. Both are written on the way out of a request, and neither is
read by anything a user can load.

The cost is kept off the request path by a cache key per user: the first
request in a WRITE_EVERY window does the writes, and every request behind it
inside that window does one cache read and nothing else. That makes last_seen
accurate to within a minute, which is all the "active now" tile needs and far
cheaper than a row update per page view. Presence is bookkeeping, so a database
that refuses these writes is logged and swallowed — it must never be the reason
a page 500s.
